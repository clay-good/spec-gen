# Change status

Which proposals are built and which are not — decided by evidence, not by each proposal's own
status line. Two signals, both cheap to re-check:

- **built** — the change's name appears in a `change: <name>` marker in `src/`, and/or every
  requirement its delta adds is already in `openspec/specs/<domain>/spec.md` (verify against the
  code before trusting a marker-less "shipped" claim)
- **archivable** — `openspec archive <name>` completes

## State as of 2026-07-27 (spec-backlog repair pass)

The corpus is fully green: **all 15 main specs and all 94 open changes pass `openspec
validate`**, and the archive machinery works again. This pass:

- **Repaired the main specs** that had blocked archiving since the corpus first drifted:
  39 decision-synced requirements fixed across `cli` (22), `mcp-handlers` (15+Purpose),
  `config` (1), `overview` (1) — missing scenarios backfilled, 11 cross-domain stubs rewritten
  as normative deferrals with pointer scenarios, 3 double-"The system SHALL" glitches fixed,
  and the missing `## Purpose` added to `mcp-handlers`. The decision-sync template recurrence
  fix shipped and was archived as `2026-08-01-fix-decision-sync-template-validity`.
- **Archived 28 changes** (as `2026-07-27-*`): the 12 formerly "built, blocked on bookkeeping",
  all 10 formerly "claims built" (each verified against the code first — all 10 were real),
  `fix-analyze-native-abort-and-file-cost-budget` (PR #294), and the 3 `defer-*` scope-decision
  records (archived `--skip-specs` as resolved doc-only changes; their won't-do rationale
  remains readable in `archive/`).
- Two archives needed delta refreshes first: `make-index-self-healing` (its MODIFIED target
  `ReadyOrHonestFirstUse` was never in the corpus — converted to a self-contained ADD) and
  `unify-navigation-and-governance-substrate` (its MODIFIED block predated the ADR-0023
  substrate-default flip — refreshed to shipped reality). Two were archived `--skip-specs`
  because their requirements were already synced verbatim (`fix-pi-parity-drift`,
  `fix-redaction-module-gaps`).

## Complete — 150 in `archive/`

Everything in `openspec/changes/archive/` is shipped (or a settled won't-do), with its
requirements reflected in the main specs. `openspec list` shows only open work.

## In flight — 1

`shrink-receiver-resolution-boundary` — chained intra-object receiver resolution
(`this.<field>.m()` / `self.<field>.m()`), on a branch with its `change:` markers in `src/`. Archive
it the moment it merges.

A change belongs here the moment its implementation starts; move it back out (archive it) the
moment its marker/spec evidence lands.

## To build — 103

The whole open set is unbuilt backlog. Newest additions: 7 proposals from the 2026-07-27
first-run e2e (`E2E-FIRSTRUN-2026-07-27.md`). Other thematic indexes:
`E2E-AUDIT-2026-07.md`, `KNOWN-LIMITATIONS-2026-07.md`,
`COMPETITIVE-SUBSTRATE-2026-07.md`.

Shipped since compile: `harden-walker-corpus-boundary` (2026-08-02, archived) — the walker
truncation receipt, includePatterns-override-directory-pruning, and nested-`.gitignore` semantics;
`harden-api-decision-and-generate-safety` (2026-08-08, archived) — decision-sync transition
enforcement, scoped TLS configuration, verification-evidence disclosure, and consolidation logs;
`fix-first-analysis-self-contamination` (2026-08-08, archived) — installer-owned artifacts no
longer skew domains, languages, or high-value files, and undomained source files are disclosed;
`fix-inject-relevance-gate-keyword-mode` (2026-08-08, archived) — exact identifier and scale-free
rank evidence make task-scoped injection reachable in the zero-config keyword mode;
`fix-empty-orient-and-corpus-honesty` (2026-08-09, archived) — empty orientations explain their
misses with bounded near-token receipts, and synthetic external nodes no longer enter the
searchable function corpus; `widen-import-resolution` (2026-08-09, archived) — Go, Java, Kotlin,
C#, and PHP now resolve statically unique package/import bindings at `import` confidence;
`add-secret-redaction-boundary` (2026-08-09, archived) — source-carrying tool results and both
sides of persisted LLM logs share deterministic, disclosed credential redaction;
`disclose-stale-serving-on-cold-reads` (2026-08-09, archived) — cold navigation reads disclose
changed cited files and active watcher/serve hosts schedule repository-scoped repair;
`align-first-run-ctas-with-repo-shape` (2026-08-09, archived) — install gates the prove CTA on
the built graph, sparse refusals carry receipts, fresh empty spec stores are informational, and
uninstall names retained data; `fix-mcp-argument-contract` (2026-08-15, archived) — omitted tool
directories resolve to the validated server launch root, explicit roots still win, and strict
advertised schemas reject unknown arguments before any watcher, rebuild, telemetry, or write;
`harden-llm-request-lifecycle` (2026-08-15, archived) — timeouts abort provider fetches and
streams, provider ceilings are constants-backed, correction requests retain their contract,
truncation is disclosed once, and fallback model ids are pricing-consistent;
`harden-review-render-and-action` (2026-08-15, archived) — PR-head text is inert in Markdown,
analysis freshness and failures are disclosed, and the bundled Action documents and enforces its
write-token trust boundary without suppressing configured policy gates;
`harden-llm-output-contract` (2026-08-16, archived) — malformed structured entries no longer
discard valid siblings, truncation and provider errors fail explicitly, and every LLM-derived
verification metric and mixed composite carries its evidence and model provenance;
`fix-commit-gate-delivery` (2026-08-16, archived) — every Git-hook installer targets Git's
effective hook path, manager-owned hooks fail honestly, doctor checks reachability, concurrent
edits are atomic, and machine JSON envelopes carry an explicit schema version.
`add-change-evidence-audit` (2026-08-16, archived) — `openlore change-status` now computes the
marker/spec-sync evidence pass with receipts, delegates typed non-interactive validation to the
OpenSpec CLI, and emits human, JSON, or pasteable table output without mutating lifecycle state.
`add-agent-loop-enforcement-hook` (2026-08-30, archived) — explicit blocking policy findings can
stop an agent turn with remediation-first feedback, while frozen findings and infrastructure
failures remain advisory; Claude Code wiring is opt-in and idempotent.

After this table was compiled, four research sweeps added 32 more proposals (all validate; not yet
folded into the table): 10 in `FIELD-RESEARCH-2026-07.md`, 10 in `ECOSYSTEM-RESEARCH-2026-07-27.md`,
5 in `SUBSTRATE-WHITESPACE-2026-07-27.md`, and 7 in `GOVERNANCE-SUBSTRATE-2026-07-31.md` — see those
indexes for the per-change one-liners.

The 2026-07-31 governance-substrate sweep is the first one aimed at the governance face rather than
the navigation face: corpus integrity, corpus-delta intent review, decision-bound constraints with
an enforcement-eligibility ledger, retrieval hit/miss evidence, derived-artifact equivalence
certification with a published scale envelope, measured standing surface cost, and a named
trust boundary for served content.

| `ground-generated-specs-in-the-graph` | resolve requirement→symbol citations against the graph |

Shipped and archived since: `refine-first-run-partial-serving` (2026-09-06) — an index-absent
first build now flushes a partial index and serves the repository structure and dependency graph
from it, with a completeness receipt attached at the dispatcher so every transport carries it,
negative conclusions withheld, and the published output still byte-identical to a single-write
build. Four rounds of adversarial review during the build also closed three PRE-EXISTING holes the
feature made reachable in the state where `.openlore/` is most likely to be adversarial (a freshly
cloned repo with no analysis): a named pipe under `.openlore/` could hang a tool call and stop the
server from exiting, the generation-manifest reads that verify every artifact were unbounded, and
a committed `.openlore/runtime` symlink redirected a recursive delete out of the repository.

Shipped and archived since: `disclose-dynamic-boundary-regions` (2026-09-06) — the call graph now
records every dispatch it cannot follow (reflection, computed members, `eval`, dynamic imports,
metaprogrammed definitions, DI resolution) as a **dynamic-boundary site**, and every conclusion whose
soundness rests on reachability discloses the sites inside the subgraph it traversed. `find_dead_code`
names the specific construct, `report_coverage_gaps` withholds `also-dead`, and `verify_claim` caps a
`dead`/`safe-to-change` verdict at `unverifiable` — disclosure only, never resolution, and never the
opposite conclusion. Four adversarial review rounds plus an end-to-end dogfood on three external
repositories found 19 defects during the build, the sharpest being a `moduleLevel` marker that was
false on 38% of sites and a retraction key that let an ordinary call erase a site outright.

## Maintenance rules (what kept this table honest)

- Ship a `change: <name>` marker in the code, or expect this table to call the change unbuilt.
- Never let a decision sync write a scenario-less requirement (see archived
  `2026-08-01-fix-decision-sync-template-validity`); `openspec validate --specs` must stay green.
- Archive promptly: a built change sitting open makes every count in this file wrong.
- Re-verify this file by re-running the evidence pass, not by trusting it.
